## Description
This project uses express routes to access a mySQL database for an example ecommerce site. It can store and manipulate information about categories, products, and tags.

## Usage
Use "npm run seed" to seed the database, then start the server with "npm run start". Make sure to change the .env file to include the username and password to your local mySQL database. The database can be accessed using an app such as Insomnia to create GET, CREATE, PUT, and DELETE requests.
